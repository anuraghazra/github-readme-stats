## Under the hood of github-readme-stats

Interested in diving deeper into understanding how github-readme-stats works?

[Bohdan](https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko) wrote a fantastic in-depth post about it, check it out:

**[Under the hood of github-readme-stats project](https://codecrumbs.io/library/github-readme-stats)**

## Local Development

To run & test github-readme-stats, you need to follow a few simple steps:-
_(make sure you already have a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account)_

1.  Install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).
2.  Fork the repository and clone the code to your local machine.
3.  Run `npm install` in the repository root.
4.  Run the command `vercel` in the root and follow the steps there.
5.  Open `vercel.json` and set the maxDuration to 10.
6.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the directory.
7.  In the .env file add a new variable named `PAT_1` with your [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
8.  Run the command `vercel dev` to start a development server at <https://localhost:3000>.
9.  The cards will then be available from this local endpoint (i.e. `https://localhost:3000/api?username=anuraghazra`).

> **Note**
> You can debug the package code in [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by using the [Node.js: Attach to process](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_setting-up-an-attach-configuration) debug option. You can also debug any tests using the [VSCode Jest extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest).

## Themes Contribution

GitHub Readme Stats supports custom theming, and you can also contribute new themes!

> **Note**
> If you are contributing your theme just because you are using it personally, then you can [customize the looks](./readme.md#customization) of your card with URL params instead.

> **Note**
> Keep in mind that we already have a vast collection of different themes. To keep their number manageable, we began to add only themes supported by the community. Your pull request with theme addition will be merged once we get enough positive feedback from the community in the form of thumbs up (see [#1935](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues/1935#top-themes-prs)). Remember that you can also support themes of other contributors that you liked to speed up their merge.

> **Note**
> Before submitting pull request, please make sure that your theme pass WCAG 2.0 level AA constrast ration test. You can use [this tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to check it.

To contribute your theme you need to edit the [themes/index.js](./themes/index.js) file and add it at the end of the file.

# :cop: Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for participation in the community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. I am committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

This community strive to:

- __Be friendly and patient__: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
- __Be welcoming__: This community welcomes and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, level of experience, sex, sexual identity and orientation, gender identity and expression, personal appearance, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- __Be respectful__: This is a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language.
  - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting, or threatening to post, peoples personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
  - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
  - Trolling.
  - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
  - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
- __Understand disagreements__: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
- This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture the common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. I expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## :telescope: Scope

This code of conduct applies to all repos and communities for my projects regardless of whether or not the repo explicitly calls out its use of this code. The code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing a project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## :man_in_tuxedo: Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## :mega: Reporting Code of Conduct Issues

Whenever possible, the community should try to resolve issues on their own. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting [codeofconduct@essing.org](mailto:codeofconduct@essing.org).

In your report please include:
- Your contact information.
- Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

All reports will be reviewed and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, we may seek insights from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will always be kept.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.

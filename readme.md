## ðŸ”„ Automated Upstream Sync

This fork is automatically kept up to date with the upstream [anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) repository.

- **How it works:**  
  A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily and merges any new changes from upstream into this fork. It uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) stored as the `SYNC_TOKEN` secret, with only the minimum permissions required (contents, workflows, and pull requests: all read & write).
- **Security:**  
  The workflow is only triggered by scheduled or manual runs, so the secret is never exposed to untrusted code or pull requests from forks.
- **Manual sync:**  
  You can also run `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` locally to manually sync with upstream if needed.

**No manual intervention is needed to keep this fork up to date!**

# :detective: Security Policy

I take the security of my software and services seriously, which includes all my repositories.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repositories, please report it as described below.

## :mega: Reporting Security Issues

__Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.__

Instead, please report them directly to me via mail at [codesec@essing.org](mailto:codesec@essing.org).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure I received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, credentials stored in code, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me to understand your report more quickly.
